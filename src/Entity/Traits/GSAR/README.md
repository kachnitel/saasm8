Stash for **default** Getters, Setters, Adders and Removers
================================================

# Purpose

Traits in this namespace are used to provide default getters, setters, adders and removers for Doctrine entities.
The goal is to provide clean entity classes where any non-trivial logic is not lost in the noise of getters and setters.
